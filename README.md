# The-Royal-Game-of-Ur-Dice---4-tetrahedron-dice
Simulates a 4 tetrahedron dice (2 painted vertex, 2 empty) fro The Royal Game of Ur

Simple program that simulates a typical 4 dice setup, with 2 painted vertex each, for the Royal Game of Ur.

I'm not a professional programmer, just a beginner. I'm sure some things could be made much better in the code.
This was made just for fun and to practice some c++. You may use the code as you wish.
